# .NET Benchmarking Guidelines

This directory contains rules for writing effective benchmarks and performance tests for .NET applications.

## [Benchmarking](benchmarking.mdc)

Use these rules when:
- Writing micro-benchmarks with BenchmarkDotNet
- Measuring performance regressions
- Analyzing memory allocations
- Testing hardware-specific optimizations
- Setting up performance testing in CI/CD

These rules ensure:
- Accurate and reproducible benchmarks
- Proper benchmark isolation
- Memory and GC analysis
- Hardware intrinsics optimization
- Performance regression tracking
- CI/CD integration for benchmarks
