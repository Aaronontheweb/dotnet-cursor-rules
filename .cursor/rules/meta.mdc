# Cursor Rules

This document outlines the meta-rules for cursor operations in this repository.

## Line Ending & Formatting Rules

1. **Line Endings**
   - Don't modify existing line endings
   - Preserve CRLF/LF as found in the original file

2. **Whitespace**
   - Preserve trailing whitespace where it exists
   - Maintain existing indentation style (spaces vs tabs)
   - Keep line length consistent with existing code

## File Handling

1. **MDC Files**
   - Always commit changes to `*.mdc` files directly
   - Ensure changes to `*.mdc` files are synchronized with their implementation
   - Maintain consistent formatting within MDC files


## Code Style & Structure

1. **Formatting**
   - Preserve existing code formatting patterns
   - Maintain consistent naming conventions
   - Keep indentation consistent with file style

2. **Organization**
   - Keep file structure consistent
   - Don't move files without updating all references
   - Maintain existing import/include order

## Documentation

1. **Examples**
    - Always include "do" and "don't" examples when showing specific changes to files or syntax
    - Include helpful comments that explain why an example is a "do" or a "don't"
